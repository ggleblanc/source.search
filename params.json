{"name":"Source.search","tagline":"Eclipse Source Search","body":"Eclipse Source Search\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\n###Introduction\r\n\r\nThe Eclipse IDE for RCP and RAP developers contains the source code\r\nfor Eclipse.  The source code is packaged in plugin JAR files \r\ncontaining the word \"source\".\r\n\r\nThe plugin directory is located at /eclipse/plugins.\r\n\r\nThree of the source JAR files in Eclipse 4.2 are:\r\n\r\n* com.ibm.icu.source_4.4.2.v20110823.jar\r\n* org.eclipse.core.commands.source_3.6.2.v20130123-162658.jar\r\n* org.eclipse.core.databinding.source_1.4.1.v20120912-132807.jar\r\n\r\nLooking inside of these source JAR files has been a painful task.\r\n\r\nTo make it easier, I decided to write a Java Swing application to\r\nextract the source classes and allow for a limited search to find\r\nthe Eclipse class that you're looking for.\r\n\r\n###Usage\r\n\r\nFirst, extract the source search source code into a Java project.\r\n  Compile and run.\r\n\r\nHere's what the main window of the application looks like:\r\n\r\n![main window](http://www.java-articles.info/images/SourceSearch.png \"Main Window\")\r\n\r\nTo find the Eclipse source JAR files, left click on the File menu\r\noption and left click on Search Directory.  Find the directory that\r\ncontains the Eclipse plugins.  On my Windows 8 computer, that\r\ndirectory is C:\\Eclipse\\eclipse-4.2 Java\\eclipse\\plugins.  Left click\r\non Open.\r\n\r\nHere's what the main window of the application looks like when\r\nyou retrieve all of the source JAR files:\r\n\r\n![JAR files window](http://www.java-articles.info/images/SourceSearchSource.png \"JAR Files Window\")\r\n\r\nYou can open the JAR files on the right to browse the Eclipse source\r\ncode, or you can search for a particular term, and see all of the\r\nEclipse source code where the search term matches.\r\n\r\nIn this case, I wanted to look at the EventManager class of the\r\nEclipse core commands.\r\n\r\n![EventManager window](http://www.java-articles.info/images/SourceSearchEventManager.png \"EventManager Window\")\r\n\r\nYou can browse or search as many times as you want.\r\n\r\nI hope this Java application will be as useful to you, an\r\nEclipse plug-in or RCP developer, as it was to me.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
